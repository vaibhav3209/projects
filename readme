READ THIS BEFORE:
1.)there are 3 files
        -->>intial_stock_code   for resetting or forming tables at start of month,add new item,change unit price etc
        -->>main                which is the shopping code for xustomer
        -->>manager_code        for manager end to check stock or reset

2.) three tables  (see respective columns)
        -->>customers(P.K. == cid)
        -->>orders(P.K. ==oid  )   ,,, FOREIGN KEY (cid,order_date) REFERENCES customers(cid,order_date)
        -->>stock(P.K. == item_name)

3.)  main.py is a function heavy file (and might be confusing)

4.)LIBRARIES USED:
        -->>tabulate
        -->>pandas              just for initial stock dataframe(idk why)
        -->>sqlite3             all the work in one database only
        -->>numpy               just once to convert np.float type of data to float to work in conn.execute()

5.)   this project took me overall  15HRS with appx 30-40% help of CHATGPT

6.) also CUSTOMER.PY  is the bruteforce way of when i thought of this project.It uses series and dataframes
in pandas library....
if you dont use it programs will run fine.
